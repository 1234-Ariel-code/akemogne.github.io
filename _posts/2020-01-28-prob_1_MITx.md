## Introduction

In the context of probability theory you may find yourself facing a question of knowing what it mean to say that a **sample space** is a **valid** sample space.

Wait! First **what is a sample** ?

Let look at a scenario where we are **flipping a [coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping)**, there is exactly 2 things that can happen here, either the how coin fell on *tail* or *head*. So the sample space in this case is the set of possible outcomes in other world an ensemble that contains all the states that our system (flipping a coin) can take.

In probability term *tail* or *head* are two event that can happen in our sample space let call it $$\omega$$ $\vec{z}$  


```bash
Hello World
```
<!-- Then you only need to press <key>Enter</key> so that the key is generated and saved in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

### Put it into the server
#### Copy the `id_rsa.pub` into your server:
```bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@10.127.1.155:~/.ssh/
```
#### Add it into the `authorized_keys`
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
``` -->
