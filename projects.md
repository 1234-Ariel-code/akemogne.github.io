-PhD Research: Representation Learning for Unstructured Genetic Data with Applications to Polygenic Analysis of Complex Traits 

My research basically focus on developing novel biostatistical and representation learning (AI/ML) methods to identify genetic factors underlying complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders, with a strong emphasis on interpretability and mechanistic insight. My research bridges statistical genetics, deep learning, and explainable AI to improve our understanding of disease biology and heritability.

- Research Project: Predicting phenotype by genotypes: a comparison of multiple models

The primary objective of this research project is to predict the observable traits or
characteristics of an organism, referred to as the phenotype, based on its genetic
makeup, or genotype. To achieve this, we employ various machine learning tech-
niques, such as ridge regression and lasso, that are commonly used in predictive
modeling.

[**Gene Golub SIAM Summer School**](https://sites.google.com/aims.ac.za/g2s3-aims-2021/groups?authuser=0)
    
- Research Project: Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predictive Variance Reduction

The summer school, founded by SIAM as the result of a generous bequest of former SIAM President Gene Golub, offers schools in applied mathematics, computational science, and industrial mathematics, primarily for graduate students in mathematics and computer science. 
As part of the [South Africa Group](https://sites.google.com/aims.ac.za/g2s3-aims-2021/groups?authuser=0), I worked on [Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predictive Variance Reduction](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/ac1dd209cbcc5e5d1c6e28598e8cbbe8-Paper.pdf).
