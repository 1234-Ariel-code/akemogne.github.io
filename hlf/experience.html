                    More than 500 ML researchers from all parts of the continent had gathered. Arrived at Nyayo Hostels
                    and immediately was welcomed by african researchers who have been to previous Indaba editions.
                    They were startled when I told them I come from India, and some of them had studied in India. As of
                    now, my university
                    has 56+ Ethiopian students learning different subfields of computer science. I was very nervous
                    about what contribution
                    I'm going to make, and before coming, I had a list prepared on how I would
                    make the most out of the Indaba. I wrote down things like Printing Visiting cards( which I handed
                    off to interested
                    researchers who liked my poster and were willing to collab), Questions for Dr.Fei Fei Lee, and
                    Andrew Ng. Watching
                    2-minute papers and reading backprop paper and thinking of ideas to pitch to future collaborators.
                    Networking and
                    internship opportunities. All sorts of things.

                    Parallels & Practicals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many things going on inside the Indaba that even if you're there, you're overwhelmed
                    with options on what to attend :) You want to attend them all.
                    Take a look at the schedule and you'll know!

                </p>

                <a href="http://www.deeplearningindaba.com/schedule-2019.html" target="_blank">

                <p>
                    Practicals were hands-on sessions on Deep Neural Networks, Generative Models, RNN, Reinforcement
                    Learning,
                    etc. I looked forward
                    to it every day. The volunteers helped in every way, they explained the math behind it so clearly,
                    and the practicals
                    are very well organized. There were optional sections in the google colab and also questions that
                    make you think with
                    your peers. The great part is that the volunteers want to improve it to another level and make it
                    more simpler, nothing
                    could be more simpler.. unless we add math visualizations like 3blue1brown :)


                </p>
                <p>

                    The talks all of them are in-depth, and one thing I knew for sure is I suck at maths for now. I was
                    studying about GANs and
                    my poster was also about GANs(Story GANs), and I got to know the problems with it only in the
                    parallel session on
                    generative models by Adji Bousso Dieng.

                    <strong> Writing a research proposal: </strong>
                     A very productive session with lots of insights and practical points
                    from George Konidaris
                    and Daniela Massiceti. I wrote my S.O.P finally very short(2 and 1/2page) and got immediate
                    feedback, and the slides are
                    a gem. They are my go-to for writing S.O.P for my masters.
                    <p>
                        Half of the book that I took notes in are full of ideas and concepts like scsampler,
                        randwire,etc
                        and understood divergence and regularization more confidently.
                        Learnt about Clevr Dataset and it's applications.
                        Awesome fun and thinking happened during the reinforcement and generative models practicals.

                    <p>
                        Dr.Manohar Paluri and Dr. Natalia Neverova's talk introduced me to the SOTA work that FAIR has
                        been doing, and they are
                        at the top in Computer Vision. Dr. Manohar is a tremendous visionary, and in one of the panel
                        discussions, he told us
                        about how he comes to a solution to a problem, and his process is fantastic to learn and apply.

                    Keynotes & Poster Sessions
                </h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Presented my First Poster ever</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    My first poster and I was so nervous, So many researchers gave me their inputs, and some were
                    interested to look deeply
                    into the papers and it's applications and would contact me for collaboration, and I'm in touch with
                    some of them.
                    Thanks to my friend Ismail for taking pictures of most of the posters and compiling it.
                    While I was presenting the poster, I also wanted to see other's work, so now and then I went to
                    their posters when no
                    one was around. Link to the posters -
                    <a href="https://mega.nz/#!PAEC2Cqb!f20UF7V8_0RSgQtYrrpeJ8FXefMmhF0gloUktXVgeZg"
                        target="_blank">Posters</a>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Keynotes:</strong> Keynotes were given by some prominent people in the research
                        community, including Richard Socher, Abdoulaye Baniro
                        Diallo, Aisha Walcott, and so many more. Ruha Benjamin's powerful talk on technology and race
                        still has everyone
                        thinking, and her books on race-ethnicity have had a global impact.

                        Everyone knows the famous Imagenet Dataset, which has transformed AI research, and Dr.Fei Fei Li
                        told us the whole
                        history behind how it came into existence and from wordnet to where we are right now. We
                        realized the importance of
                        datasets is as much as the importance of algorithms.

                <h2>
                    Sauti Yetu(Our Voice) </h2>

                <p>
                    This year we say Sauti Yetu/Our Voice. Our voice can be strong; our voice can create change; we have
                    many different
                    voices that must be heard. We hope that you will use the Indaba as part of your voice. As the Indaba
                    starts and then
                    ends for this third year, we ask that all of us, together, raise our voice, to be more confident, to
                    take more
                    ownership, and to continue working towards the responsible technology that will help us build the
                    next age of
                    pan-African prosperity.

                <h2>
                    Life after Indaba: </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm doing the #30daysofMLcode the 2nd time, and I'm almost close to reading Marc sir's book Maths
                    for
                    ML. Also, reading
                    weekly research papers and following Twiml's webinars and focusing on my startup.

                    The swags and free TPU's are always worth to mention. They are put to good use.
                    A part of me understood how little I knew of what I already knew was little. I realized where I need
                    to put my focus on
                    and which subfield suits best for me.

                    Deep learning Indaba has helped me to know a lot of things deeply; I have come to realize my true
                    potential and where my
                    purpose lies, which frankly I had no idea before.
                    And I have figured out - I am going to pursue further studies, and I'm going to do community events and give talks
                    once I have little
                    knowledge
                </p>


                <h2>Closing Gratitude</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="../images/thanks.jpg">

                    I have missed out on a lot of important sessions like the Hackathon track and the sessions which I
                    haven't attended but watching the videos now that they are on Youtube.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Big Thank you to Ayodele Olabiyi - he was sitting just left to me when he was called on the stage to
                    receive his award.
                    Your emotions shook me - gave me goosebumps. He was like will smith from the pursuit of happyness.
                    All of us who saw you
                    saw your passion and hard work, and that inspires us.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you with all my heart to all the Indaba organizers, sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and the
                    participants for
                    giving your best to this amazing and enriching community.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Indaba Forever x </strong>
                    <br>

                    Not to forget the amazing memories apart from academics - networking sessions every time, the
                    after-party, and the
                    welcoming party and people who went to have the best burger in Kenya, the wine when it rained. All
                    these made it more
                    splendid and beautiful.
                    Indaba is more than a conference; it is about the future and how we collectively can improve it and
                    also does so by
                    giving opportunities to so many researchers.<br>
                    Thank you &#9996;
                </p>
