### About Me
I am Ariel Ghislain Kemogne Kamdoum. Currently pursuing my PhD studies in Biostatistics at the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/) in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and in collaboration with the Faculty of Medecine and the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular
Biology,I am working on developing machine learning models and applying them to biological/medical data. My research basically focuses on novel biostatistical and machine learning methods for identifying genetic factors associated with complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
 
Indeed, I have a background in mathematics and computer science with a specialization in machine intelligence, as I have a Master's degree in mathematics from the [University of Dschang, Cameroon](https://www.univ-dschang.org/), where I worked in the Algebraic Topology field, specifically on the following topic: “(Co)Homology of Configuration Spaces”, where I was able to show that there exist an algorithm that allow us to compute the (co)homology groups of configuration spaces generated by a certain given topological space. This result has an incredible application in robotic, because it allows us to find a path for a given robot going from an initial point A to a final point B, just by knowing a different (co)homology groups and topology of its configuration spaces associated. In regard of the beauty of Mathematical Sciences and what it does in applied domains, I was more and more motivated to
know more about and improving my knowledge. That is why after completing my Master’s degree in mathematics at Dschang University in Cameroon, I joined both the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in Senegal](https://aims-senegal.org/) in 2018, where I got my Msc in Mathematical Sciences, and the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in Ghana](https://aims.edu.gh/) in 2019, where I received my Msc in Machine Intelligence in 2021 on the following research topic: "Optimization and Generalization of Shallow Neural Networks with Quadratic Activation Functions", from the master program [African Master in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI), sponsored by Facebook and Google. 

To conclude, having also several working experiences in companies as I worked as a data scientist at [ICRISAT/MANOBI](https://www.manobi.com/), where using data intelligence for delivering digital solutions, services for businesses, development projects, service providers in Africa’s water and agricultural sectors on providing robust monitoring and evaluation reports, and sustainable management solutions, and as I worked as a production team member and teaching assistant in deep learning and neuroscience at [Neuromatch Academy (NMA)](https://academy.neuromatch.io/), I am passionate about applying mathematics(statistics) and computer science(machine intelligence) to solve real life problems. So, currently a member of the [Quan Long's Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/quanlongresearch/home?authuser=0) at the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/) in Canada, while doing my PhD in Biostatistics, I am so excited to provided amazing and impactful results in the field.
