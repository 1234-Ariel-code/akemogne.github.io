### About Me

I'm Ariel Ghislain Kemogne Kamdoum, a PhD researcher at the [University of Calgary, Canada](https://www.ucalgary.ca/), where I develop novel biostatistical and representation learning (AI/ML) methods to identify genetic factors underlying complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders, with a strong emphasis on interpretability and mechanistic insight. My research bridges statistical genetics, deep learning, and explainable AI to improve our understanding of disease biology and heritability.

My academic foundation is in Mathematics and Computer Science, with a focus on Machine Intelligence. I completed my Master's degree in Mathematics from the [University of Dschang, Cameroon](https://www.univ-dschang.org/), Cameroon, where I explored algebraic topology and its applications in robotics. Motivated by the profound implications of Mathematical Sciences, I expanded my education at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), earning two MSc degrees from [Senegal](https://aims-senegal.org/) and [Ghana](https://aims.edu.gh/) in Mathematical Sciences and [Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/), respectively.

My professional experience includes data science roles at [ICRISAT/MANOBI](https://www.manobi.com/) and teaching assistant positions at [Neuromatch Academy (NMA)](https://academy.neuromatch.io/), focusing on deep learning and neuroscience. Currently, as a part of [Quan Long's Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/quanlongresearch/group-members?authuser=0) at the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/), I am enthusiastically applying my combined expertise in statistics and machine intelligence to address real-world challenges.

### Awards 

1- 2023 Alberta Innovates Graduates Scholarship, 2023-2026

2- Indigenous and Black Momentum Scholarship in Science, 2022-2023

3- Graduate Teaching Assistant (GAT) Excellence Award Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Calgary, 2024

Innovations:  
As an Alberta Innovates Scholar, I contribute to Alberta’s digital health ecosystem through the design and development of AI-powered Digital Health Advisors (DHAs) at VirtuClinic Inc., in collaboration with innovation networks connected to Alberta Innovates and Technology Alberta. My work focuses on translating advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing research into scalable, real-world digital health systems that enhance virtual care delivery, mental-health support, patient engagement, and healthcare operations across Alberta. I lead the technical architecture and governance of DHAs with a strong emphasis on privacy-preserving design, ensuring full compliance with Canadian health data regulations, including HIA, PIPEDA, POPA, and FOIP, and guaranteeing that no Personal Health Information is stored, processed, or transmitted by these systems. Through this work, I support Alberta’s strategic priorities in responsible AI, health system innovation, and technology commercialization by building trustworthy, regulation-compliant AI solutions that improve access to care, operational efficiency, and digital health readiness across the province.
